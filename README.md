# dev-interview-scheduling

Public sample data for a git-interactive prototype.

There isn't a whole lot going on here, just some scripts to generate fake json
data as I experiment with data structure.

These must be run in order.

```
node generate-01-skills.js
node generate-02-interviewers.js
node generate-03-scheduled.js
```
